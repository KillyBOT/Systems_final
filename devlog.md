## 1.2.20

I started to work on the bare minimum for the game, such as the header files. In other words, I didn't do anything today.

## 1.3.20

Today, I worked on the makefile and the general structure. I didn't finish the makefile, but the general structure of the program was fairly solidified at this point.

## 1.5.20

I was quite productive today. I finished a majority of the game functions, and got SDL running well. This means that the game engine is now complete! I'm surprised that I finished it so quickly. Hopefully the networking will be as easy...

## 1.7.20

Networking is difficult, especially when you don't have a good idea of what type of structure you want for your server. I started to play around with some different structures, but all of them were insufficient. I eventually bit the bullet and decided that I would just wait for each player to respond and would then reply to each player, meaning that the speed of the game is dependent on the slowest player. For a game like this however, I actually think it works alright.
