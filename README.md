# Systems Final Project : Snake Eater

## Description

The game is basically a competitive version of snake. Each player starts at the corner of a map, and starts to move forward. They can turn left or right, like in snake. However, instead of Snake, each player leaves a line behind them. The goal of the game is to survive the longest without running into
your or into another person's line. This game will use some networking for local multiplayer, and maybe I'll shoehorn in some other systems related things.

Note: This game's original idea is based on an old game I played when I was younger called Armageddon I think. I can't find the original game, but when I do I will definitely link it in the readme.
